 <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Overview</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            Having moved 4 times in the last 3 years, I sympathize with the difficulty people have during a move. From scheduling your move, to packing, to the day of the move, it’s not uncommon to just want it to all be over. Reflecting on my own experiences, I set out to uncover the difficulties people experience during moves and develop a product that can help ease some of the pain points.
        </p>
    </div>

 <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Problem</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            Moving is expensive. According to Forbes, these are the average costs of moves in the USA:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox-style-2">
        <h2 class="problem-pakt"><strong>$300 - $6,900</strong> for short distance moves & <strong>$3,200 - $17,000</strong> for long distance move</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox-style-1">
    <p class="text-style-1">
            On top of these base costs, you must factor in the customary 15-20% tip and the cost of packing materials. When totaled up, the price of a move can be very steep. Another consideration is the time required to prepare and pack an apartment or house of any size. Typically, packing a 1-bedroom apartment alone can demand up to two full days of dedicated time.
        </p>
    </div>

 <!-- RESEARCH -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">The Research</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            With this problems in mind, I set out to discuss with users and hear first hand the problems they dealt with during moves of their own. Here are the 3 research methods I employed:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox-style-2">
        <div class="textbox-inside-style-2">
            <h4 class="text-section-title-style-pakt">1. Competitive Analysis</h4>
            <p class="text-style-2">
                Evaluating companies within the moving market like U-Haul, TaskRabbit, Unpakt, My move, and Piece of Cake Moving to understand their strengths, weaknesses, strategies, and market positioning.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="textbox-inside-style-2">
            <h4 class="text-section-title-style-pakt">2. User Interviews</h4>
            <p class="text-style-2">
                Gathering qualitative data through one-on-one conversations with people who have experience with and insight on the packing process.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="textbox-inside-style-2">
            <h4 class="text-section-title-style-pakt">3. Secondary Research</h4>
            <p class="text-style-2">
                Drawing insights and information from online sources, publications, and cutting-edge technology to enhance understanding of the packing process.

    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Key Findings</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            From my research, a key learning that stuck with me was that cost matters. The cost of the packing process significantly impacts the selection of resources people opt to utilize.

        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">User Personas</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            After conducting user interviews, I developed two personas to capture the personalities, challenges, and goals of my users. Ethan and Lila exemplify users from diverse age groups and income brackets united by a common objective: saving money. Creating two personas was essential for me to cater to individuals from various backgrounds, all striving towards a shared goal.

    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">POV & HMW Statement</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            By crafting personas and analyzing my research data, my goal was to tackle a specific issue posed by this question:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox-style-2">
        <h2 class="pov-and-hmw-pakt">How might we help people packing for a move save money on packing supplies?</h2>

<!-- THE BIG IDEA -->
 <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">The Big Idea</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
With this question in mind, I began to think of possible solutions. Here’s the one that stuck:
<br>
<br>
<strong>An online platform where individuals or businesses who have recently relocated can easily donate their gently used packing supplies, while also allowing others to conveniently acquire the packing materials they need.</strong>
<br>
<br>
A platform like this would save both individuals and businesses money, while satisfying the goals of users like Lila and Ethan who seek cost-effective solutions and sustainability in their moving endeavors.        </p>
    </div>

 <!-- SITE MAP -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Site Map</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            The site map below attempts to satisfy the idea of a two sided marketplace, with both “create listing” and “browse listing” pages, allowing users to participate in every part of the donation cycle. Ultimately reducing their expenditure on packing supplies.

 <!-- USER FLOWS -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">User Flows</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            Referring to the site map, I created user flows to break down the steps users need to complete in order to sign up, post a listing, and find packing materials.
            <br>
            <br>
            The 'Post a listing' page was split into two pages due to the increasing amount of required information. Additionally, within this flow, I incorporated an option to save as a draft, accommodating users who may not have all the necessary information ready at the time of creation.

        <p class="text-style-1">
            When creating the task flows, I prioritized ensuring smooth transitions between different user tasks. It was crucial for me to integrate the 'Dashboard' page into each flow, allowing users to seamlessly switch between posting and browsing as needed.

        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            After mapping out the site and determining the most logical user and task flows, I began building the low and mid-fidelity wireframes. I incorporated user research insights to design in a way that appeals to younger, tech-savvy audiences.

    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">High-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            With the branding established, the next step was to integrate it seamlessly into the design. Here were some important considerations:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Home Page</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            The primary goal of the home page was to enable users to find and donate supplies according to their needs. 
            It was essential to provide an overview of the site's functionality so that users could grasp its capabilities. 
            For example, there are buttons throughout the page where users can either donate or find supplies.        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Create a Listing</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            Users who wish to donate are encouraged to create a listing from the homepage, but they must first create an account to proceed. These pages offer donors various options for items they can contribute and provide fields to input essential information such as zip code, quantity, and photos, facilitating seekers in filtering their requirements effectively. Users are also able to save their listing as a draft to post later.        </p>
    </div>

        <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Browse Listings</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            The browse listings page features a map displaying the user's zip code and nearby areas. With its search and filter functions, users can navigate listings more effectively. Users can also share and save listings, and message the lister directly to claim advertised items. In cases where availability doesn't align, users can utilize the Uber Connect feature to transport items securely without needing direct contact with the other party.

 <!-- USER TESTING -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">User Testing</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
        During the testing phase, users were asked to complete two tasks: listing an item and finding an item. All users (100%) rated both tasks 5 out of 5 for ease of completion, with 5 indicating "very easy." However, a few suggestions for improvement were provided:        </p>

        <p class="text-style-1">
            Once the feedback from the user testing was received, I went back to the wireframes and added their suggestions.
    </div>

     <div class="textbox-style-1-iterations">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Quantity Input</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            Three out of five users suggested adding a quantity input field on the second page of the "Create a Listing" form. This recommendation aimed to streamline the user experience by removing the need to search for quantity details within item descriptions and to enable donors to list multiple items more efficiently.  </p>

        <p class="text-style-1">
        One user highlighted the need for a search bar in the Browse Listings section, noting that the existing filter button was not efficient enough. The suggested improvement was intended to help users locate items more quickly and provide multiple ways to search, enhancing overall usability.

            There are numerous opportunities for further iteration and expansion of Pakt. Imagine incorporating sustainability metrics, integrating social media for listing sharing, or implementing a savings tracker for users to monitor their savings during their move. With endless possibilities ahead, I am eager to continue testing with users to enhance the platform's utility and delightfulness.
