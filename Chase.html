<!--PROBLEM-->
<div class="project-info-container">
<div class="project-stage">PROBLEM</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">Hidden costs derail travel budgets</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">International travelers struggle with financial uncertainty when making purchases abroad. Without real-time visibility into currency conversions and foreign transaction fees, users often discover unexpected charges after returning home. This lack of transparency leads to overspending, budget anxiety, and hesitation to use their Chase cards while traveling.</div>
</div>

<!--RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES-->
<div class="project-info-container">
<div class="project-stage">RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">How I identified my users and their needs</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">To validate my assumptions and identify pain points in mobile banking for international travelers, I conducted user interviews with people who travel internationally. I wanted to understand people’s travel spending patterns, their experiences with mobile banking apps abroad, and their understanding around currency exchange information. I discovered that users frequently experience post-trip surprises about charges and not much real-time visibility into conversion rates. The interviews revealed a need for transparent, easy to find currency information and proactive fee disclosure during international transactions. This project also demanded a thorough understanding of foreign transaction fees and up-to-date currency exchange information, so secondary research to educate myself was necessary. </div>

<div class="project-stage">01 COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">Taking a look at mobile banking app’s travel features</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">I analyzed Chase, Wise, PayPal, and XE Currency to understand their international features. While each offers basic currency services, traditional banking apps like Chase lack integrated real-time exchange rates and conversion tools. This forces travelers to juggle multiple apps, and creates an opportunity for Chase to build comprehensive international features directly into their platform.</div>

<!--USER INTERVIEWS-->
<div class="project-info-container">
<div class="project-stage">02 USER INTERVIEWS</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">The pain points of frequent travelers</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">I interviewed 5 frequent international travelers to understand their banking experiences abroad. Key findings revealed that users are uninformed about exchange rates and rely on Google for conversions, often discovering fees after transactions occur. Users want integrated currency calculators, real-time exchange rate information, and upfront fee transparency within their banking apps because they often feel that google isn’t always exactly accurate. The research confirmed that travelers currently juggle multiple tools and face post-trip surprises about costs, validating the need for a comprehensive international feature in banking apps.

<div class="project-stage-title">Final designs for the Currency & fees feature</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">To save time, and since Chase already has an established brand identity, I skipped low-fidelity wireframes and branding work, moving directly into high-fidelity design. I replicated the UI on the mobile banking app to make sure the designs for the new feature were consistent with the existing design. The small number of screens required for this feature resulted in a quick project timeline. Below are all the pages that make up the new feature.
<br>
<br>
Users can access the feature by navigating to the "Currency & Fees" button in the "Travel & Dining" section on the "More" page. Here, they can convert currencies, check exchange rate history, and view foreign transaction fees based on their location and the fee history associated with their cards. Since not all Chase cards incur foreign transaction fees, I also included a screen view for cards with no fees to ensure clarity for all users.</div>

<div class="project-stage-blurb">As a new feature for Chase, it's important to consider how it will be introduced to users. The most effective approach would be to notify them directly through an app notification and provide alerts when they begin making purchases abroad. Additionally, users would be prompted to enable location services, allowing the app to automatically set their currency and see foreign transaction fee to the one that corresponds with their location.</div>

<div class="project-stage-blurb">To evaluate the usability and ease of this new feature, I asked users to complete two tasks: converting a currency to their home currency and checking the amount charged in foreign transaction fees. While both tasks were straightforward for all users, there was common confusion about the meaning of the numbers in the foreign transaction fee section. Below are the user’s reactions and questions regarding the presentation of the foreign transaction fee charge display.

<div class="project-stage-blurb">Once the feedback from the user testing was received, I went back to the wireframes and added their suggestions. Since there was confusion on what the small blue numbers meant underneath each transaction made abroad. I had to re-think the way these foreign transaction fee amounts were displayed.
<br>
<br>
To maintain consistency with other screens, I decided to label any deductions from the bank account in red. Additionally, I realized it was clearer to display only the foreign transaction fee amount to avoid any confusion that the fee was being subtracted from the original purchase amount.</div>
