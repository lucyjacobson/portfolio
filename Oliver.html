<!--PROBLEM-->
<div class="project-info-container">
<div class="project-stage">PROBLEM</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">Medication Adherence Matters</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">Everyone forgets to take their medication at some point, some more often than others. Sometimes, missing a dose can result in a longer recovery time. Other times, consequences can be more extreme. For example, if people with Parkinson's disease delay their medication intake by even one hour, they can experience an immediate increase in symptoms (Grissinger, 2018). Seeing how missed doses affected loved ones with Parkinson’s showed me how important timely medication is for them and for many others with chronic conditions. That insight led me to build a simple, unobtrusive tool to help people stay on track with their treatment.</div>

<!--RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES-->

<div class="project-stage-title">How I identified my users and their needs</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">This project tackles a problem I’ve seen first hand, loved ones struggling with medication adherence. But I knew there was more to the story. I spoke with people with different routines and regimens to learn why doses were being missed and why their current reminders weren’t enough. What I found was a clear gap between how people want to manage their medications and the limited, often inconvenient tools available to them. Here's how I did that:</div>

<div class="project-stage-title">A look at existing medication reminder tools</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">I investigated the leading apps available on the App Store: MyTherapy, Medisafe, RoundHealth, and EveryDose. Each app had its advantage, some allowing for personalized reminders tailored to your schedule, information on drug interactions, or integration with caregivers and healthcare providers. However, advanced features can be locked behind paywalls and the apps lack behavioral reinforcement or consistent follow ups for delayed reminders.</div>

<div class="project-stage-title">Why do people forget to take their medication?</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">I spoke with 5 users, each varying in age and medication regimen. Some users only took antibiotics for temporary medications, while some took medications upwards of 4 times per day. The diversity in medication regimen helped me visualize an app that caters to varying needs. I set out to find: (1) behavioral patterns around medication adherence, (2) pain points with current tools or methods, (3) what users need to know about their medications. Because the topic of medications and healthcare can be a sensitive subject, I let my participants know they don’t have to share any information they’re not comfortable with and that the details of this interview (prescriptions, illnesses) will not be shared.

<div class="project-stage">SYNTHESIS</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">Insights from the interviews</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">Throughout the interviews I noticed some patterns forming in the responses of the participants, particularly regarding the way they remembered (or didn't) to take their medications. I learned that while people are generally curious about their medications and their effects, they don't put much of a routine in place to remember to take them. Two users noted keeping their meds in places that were easily accessible to serve as a visual cue to take them, while other users primarily rely on memory alone.</div>

<div class="project-info-container-extra">
<div class="project-stage-blurb">Not every medication is time-critical, but there are those that, when administered even 30 minutes after the scheduled dose, can lead to suboptimal therapy and patient harm. After wrapping up the interviews I began to wonder about ways people can build habits and form routines, especially involving medication, that didn't just involve alerts from a phone. What happens when reminders aren't available? Can routines form without constant prompts? Is it possible to create a tool that supports adherence without creating dependence?</div>

<div class="project-stage-title">Defining project, user, business, and technical goals</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">With the insights gathered from my research, I began mapping out how to address the most prominent pain points. There were many potential directions (medication interaction and safety info, prescription refills, caregiver support), and it was easy to feel pulled in too many at once. To stay focused, I narrowed the scope to a single goal: helping users build lasting habits around medication adherence. That said, I kept in mind how other features could be integrated later to support a more holistic experience.

These personas helped shape a solution that supports different lifestyles and levels of medication complexity.</div>

<div class="project-stage-title">Framing the problem around habits, not just reminders</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">Clear patterns from my research indicated that users didn't just need reminders, but would benefit from being able to create lasting habits around taking their medication, so as not to become reliant on their mobile device and have to constantly interact with it.</div>

    At this point, it was clear the issue wasn't just about forgetting, it was about routine. Reminders help, but they don’t guarantee consistency. Before I moved into creating a feature set knew I needed to better understand the psychology of habits: how they're formed and what makes them stick.  </p>

<div class="project-stage">FURTHER RESEARCH</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">The psychology of habit building</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">I began this secondary research phase by digging into a few academic papers about habits and how they've been known to stick. I then moved on to existing apps that deal with habit building and examined how they incorporated these habit-building principles into their own design. Here's what I found:</div>

I considered the insight from my research that people don't want to interact with an app too much, and thought of more ways/features that could automate the experience as much or as little as someone would like. For instance, scanning the medication packaging to instantly add information, integrating the app with an Apple Watch for reminders, and marking medication as taken or skipped, and the option to set goals, as some users may just want the app for reminders only.</div>

<div class="project-stage-blurb">I created 4 user flows to visualize the main actions users will complete in the app: <strong>Signing up, adding a medication, adding a goal, </strong>and <strong>editing a reminder time.</strong> The flows helped me realize that a reminder should be directly tied to a medication. For instance, if I add Spironolactone to my medication list, I will also need to input the time I'm supposed to take it, instead of adding medications and reminders separately. The timing of the reminder can be edited in the "My Medications" page and the user will be able to set multiple reminders for the same medication, in case they want a notification before or at the time of event.</div>

<!--ITERATIONS-->
<div class="project-info-container">
<div class="project-stage">ITERATIONS</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">Changes made based on feedback</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">I made four changes based on user testing feedback. The most impactful was refining the input fields to more accurately reflect real prescription details. Users often confused terms like “quantity” and “amount,” so I adjusted the language for better clarity and alignment with how prescriptions are typically written.

    </div>
    
    <div class="feature-card">
      <h3 class="feature-title">Family Member / Caregiver Access</h3>

  <div class="phase-tag">PHASE 3</div>
  <div class="phase-section">
    <div class="feature-card">
      <h3 class="feature-title">Pharmacy Integration</h3>
      <p class="feature-description">This feature would allow direct integration with pharmacies, allowing users to seamlessly request refills through their preferred pharmacy, track refill status, and receive updates on pickup or delivery.</p>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <h3 class="feature-title">Medication Dispenser Integration</h3>
      <p class="feature-description">Enable direct integration with compatible smart medication dispensers to automatically track when a dose is dispensed. This eliminates the need for manual logging and results in more accurate adherence data.</p>
