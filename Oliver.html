 <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Overview</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            It can be difficult remembering to take your medication and even more difficult when you’re prescribed
            three or four. In today’s fast-paced world, medication adherence can significantly affect health outcomes,
            particularly for individuals managing chronic conditions or complex treatment plans.
        </p>
    </div>

 <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Problem</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            Conversations with five different users underscored a common issue: everyone forgets to take their
            medication at some point, with some doing so more frequently than others. While missing a dose might
            result in a longer recovery time for some, in some cases the consequences can be more extreme. For example,
            missing a dose of blood pressure medication can increase a person’s risk of heart attack, stroke,
            or kidney failure. Similarly, missing multiple doses of antidepressants may result in symptoms of
            withdrawal.

 <!-- RESEARCH -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">The Research</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            In the research portion of this project, it was important for me to speak with a range of users with
            medication regimens across the spectrum. My research helped me discover the common issue of medication
            non-adherence and my secondary research helped me confirm this and understand some common reasons as to why
            people miss their doses. I completed a competitive analysis to find the areas of existing apps and tools
            that needed to be improved and implemented these updates into my design.

            <h4 class="text-section-title-style-oliver">1. Competitive Analysis</h4>
            <p class="text-style-2">
                In my competitive analysis of four medication reminder apps, I found that they were neither engaging nor
                comprehensive in their setup. Key features such as drug interactions, personalized reminders, and
                integration with a medication database were often lacking. Furthermore, the user interface was less
                engaging than it could have been.

        </div>

        <div class="textbox-inside-style-2">

            <p class="text-style-2">
                I spoke with 5 users, each varying in age and medication regimen. Some users only took antibiotics for
                temporary medications, while some took medications upwards of 4 times per day. The diversity in
                medication regimen in the sample size helped to make the app usable for people with varying needs.

        <div class="textbox-inside-style-2">
            <h4 class="text-section-title-style-oliver">3. Secondary Research</h4>
            <p class="text-style-2">
                My secondary research brought an understanding of some of the underlying causes of why people don’t
                adhere to their medication routine. I found that a common reason is due to not fully understanding
                intake instructions. This was helpful in gaining a deeper level of empathy for the potential users and
                to deciding the most important features to be included.

            The findings from my research reinforced my belief in the need for a medication reminder app that includes
            timely reminders, side effect and interaction information, pharmacy integration, and detailed input forms.
            In essence, the goal is to create a comprehensive, user-friendly app that caters to all ages. The cards

        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">User Personas</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            I developed two personas to effectively represent the diverse medication needs of users based on insights
            from my interviews. For example, Joan takes up to four medications daily and requires frequent, customizable
            reminders to manage her routine effectively. In contrast, Emily, who only takes one medication, prioritizes
            privacy and prefers discreet notifications in public settings. These differences informed the design of the
            app’s notification features, allowing for tailored options that cater to various lifestyles.

        <p class="text-style-1">
            To understand what might frustrate and delight the customer during their journey, I created a customer
            journey map. It helped me grasp why someone would need an app like this and what features could foster
            loyalty and keep them engaged. For example, incorporating gamification elements like badges or streaks for
            consistent medication use could motivate users by celebrating milestones, such as taking their medication on
            time for 3 weeks straight.

        <p class="text-style-1">
            By crafting personas, the customer journey, and analyzing my research data, my goal was to address the
            issues posed by this question:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox-style-2">
        <h2 class="pov-and-hmw-oliver">How might we create a platform that gives timely medication reminders, <br>simplified

 <!-- USER FLOWS -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">User Flows</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            To address the “How Might We” question, I created user flows for adding a new medication, updating
            notification preferences, and viewing medication interactions. These flows directly tackle the three main
            concerns identified in the question.
            <br>
            <br>
            The most challenging flow to visualize was the “Add a new medication” process. Initially, I thought it could
            be condensed into a single page. However, as I developed the input page, I realized that the lengthy and
            complex nature of medication details required a split into two sections: one for medication information and
            another for timing and notification preferences. I also considered that older users might feel fatigued by a
            long form, so breaking it up helps create a more user-friendly experience.

 <!-- LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            I began the low-fidelity wireframes by designing the “home” page, or medication reminder overview, since I
            knew it would be the most viewed and interacted with screen. This initial design laid the foundation for the
            subsequent screens. From there, I developed key features, such as the “add a new medication” page, where
            users can input detailed information, including timing and instructions. The medication page also allows
            users to access additional information about their prescriptions or edit their inputs.
            <br>
            <br>
            To enhance usability, particularly for older users who may feel fatigued by lengthy forms, I included an
            option to scan the prescription label for automatic input of medication details. Throughout the design
            process, I focused on maintaining a minimal and clean layout, prioritizing the timing of medication
            reminders.

        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Low-Fidelity Wireframe Testing</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            Before transitioning to the branding phase and high-fidelity wireframes, I tested the existing screens.
            Users found the app easy to use and understand but encountered confusion with the new medication form,
            particularly with the “Quantity” input next to “Dosage” and “Unit.” While I intended it to indicate the
            number of pills to take, users found it confusing, interpreting it as either the quantity of pills in the
            bottle or conflicting with the milligram dosage. After careful consideration and discussions with users
            about their preferences, I decided to remove this input from the form.

 <!-- BRANDING -->
    <div class="textbox-style-1">
        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Branding</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            I sought to establish a unique brand identity for this medication reminder app that embodies warmth, trust,
            friendliness, empathy, support, and positivity. When choosing a name for the application, I reflected on
            someone who truly embodies these qualities—my dog, Oliver. And that's how the name was born.
            <br>
            <br>
            To achieve this, I incorporated lighthearted illustrations and warm colors. The main logo features a waving
            pill, while the app logo is a zoomed-in version of the pill's face, ensuring privacy and anonymity in
            notifications.

        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">High-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            From low-fidelity wireframes to the final designed screens, I focused on creating a robust sign-up flow that
            allows users to input their essential information and set personalized reminders. To enhance the app's
            friendly and warm atmosphere, I included lighthearted illustrations throughout the sign-up process.
            <br>
            <br>
            To avoid overwhelming users with information during the sign-up process, it was important to allow them to
            set up their medication and pharmacy details at a later time.
        </p>

            After completing the sign-up process, users gain access to reminder overviews, medication summaries, and
            their profiles, where they can update their information.
            <br>
            <br>
            When users receive medication reminders, they can mark a dose as taken by tapping the circle on the right
            side of the corresponding medication card, which will display a checkmark to indicate that the medication
            has been administered.
            <br>
            <br>
            Two of the most critical and tedious screens were the new medication input form and the prescription
            instructions page. Low-fi wireframe testing helped me streamline the form, making it easier for users to
            understand what information was required. The data entered is presented in a more digestible format on the
            medication information screen.

        <h4 class="text-section-title-style-1">Reminder Notifications</h4>
        <p class="text-style-1">
            A key consideration in designing this app was how reminders appear on users' devices. Notifications could
            either be detailed, naming the medication, or kept private for discretion. An Apple Watch notification
            option was also included, allowing users to receive reminders more privately and conveniently.
            <br>
            <br>
            During research, one user expressed frustration with cluttered notifications and frequent app interactions.
            To address this, I added an option for users to mark a dose as “taken” or “snooze” the reminder directly
            from their lock screen.

            User feedback made it clear that the refill notification needed adjustment. The current design resembled an
            alert, which led users to think it was related to taking or missing a dose. After exploring refill reminder
            designs, I implemented the version shown on the right. When I shared it with users, they all agreed it was a
            clearer and more accurate refill reminder.

            There are many future opportunities to expand this app. A user I interviewed mentioned that some
            prescriptions taper in frequency over time, or require more detailed instructions for proper adherence.
            Additional features could include syncing with other health apps and enabling in-app doctor chat. Since this
            project only covered the MVP, there’s a lot of room to grow.
